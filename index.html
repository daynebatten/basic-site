            <h1>Dayne Batten</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Dayne Batten. I'm a data scientist, a husband, a dad, and a follower of Jesus (though not in that order).</p>
            <p>In my professional life, I'm building indoor and outdoor location technology for <a href="https://relaypro.com/">Relay</a>. We're on a mission to improve communication, safety, and efficiency for active workers.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working, you might find me camping with my three boys, cycling on the many greenways in the Raleigh area, or reading and writing about Christian theology.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, <a href="https://forms.gle/fStH2UkuaqEJuoy66">please do</a>! I'd love to hear from you.</p>
